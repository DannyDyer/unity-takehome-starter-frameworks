# unity-takehome-starter-frameworks

We have provided two starter frameworks here for node.js and golang. You'll be building a small service using one of these frameworks (your choice) so please make sure you can build and run the chosen framework before beginning the exercise. 

Note for Windows users: you will need a posix style test environment - Cygwin, Ubuntu for Windows, etc.
